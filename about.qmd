My name is Phan Anh Vu (VÅ©).

I have studied Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics and Finance. 
I took a Software Engineer position for a few years. 
Most recently, I mainly work on Machine Learning.
More specifically, the research topic for my PhD is the intersection of probabilistic machine learning and hardware design.
The goal is to accelerate uncertainty quantification algorithms with specialized and emerging circuits, both analog and digital.

Here is a probably outdated Curriculum Vitae
